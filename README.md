# MargeRunner

I made this project to try out marge mechanics and for our team RPS mobile games.

# How To Play
Our main goal in the game is to get the car to the finish line. To do this, we need to improve the car, and after completing the improvements, we discover how far we can take the car by playing. In order to get energy, we need to make matches; we can increase our energy level by matching the right pieces.
